#%% Set up simulation box

# Solvent setup (e.g., TIP3P water model)
wat = Water(model="ewald")

# add extra specie (e.g. ammonia) with LigParGen

#%% Create a SimulationBox instance

# here we set the water as solvent

# add subsequent layers of building blocks

    # - int: same number for all ion types, e.g., nspecies: 1

    # - None: no ions (solvent only)

# For concentration-based approach:
# {"type": "solvent", "rho": 1.0, "zdim": 25, "concentration": 0.1}

# For different numbers of each ion type:
# {"type": "solvent", "rho": 1.0, "zdim": 25, "nspecies": [2, 3]}

# For backward compatibility (deprecated):
# {"type": "solvent", "rho": 1.0, "zdim": 25, "nions": 1}
